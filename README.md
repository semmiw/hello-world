Just another awesome repository

Hi Humans! 

I just arrived from a spaceship, returning back to Earth because I miss eating sushi and listening to Beyonce. :) No, but seriously, I am the co-founder of beverage start-up and a recovering media professional. I am really interested in data journalism and how programming/software architecture/graphic design can be used to help tell stories. I truly believe different programming languages can help empower underrepresented voices and communities across mainstream media platforms/outlets. I look forward to contributing!
